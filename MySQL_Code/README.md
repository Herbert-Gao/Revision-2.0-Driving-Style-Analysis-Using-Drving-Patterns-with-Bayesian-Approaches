# Get Data

If this step, we will deal with dataset from row. But before that, we need to clear what kind of data we want:

1. Ticking out bad data point in collecting.
2. Following scenarion rules.
3. Pick *Driver* who has enough effective driving data.

## To do that, please read articles patietly

"Driving Style Analysis Using Primitive Driving Patterns With Bayesian Nonparametric Approaches" is the main paper that we will follow to experiment. Try to read the paper more than just once. Other papers can help understand it. These three articles will be enough to understand what writer is trying to tell us. If you are still confused with it, leave a message and I will send you a explaination paper in Chiese(my graduation work), it should help a lot.

## After Reading

From the paper, we will know that the dataset should satisfy the following items:

1. Carfollowing scenarios.
2. We need to collect Range, Rangerate and Ax data.
3. In details, Mini-range should be not less than
